In this repository, you can access all my personal projects I have done so far.
Here, you can see two folders and two different projects [ END-TO-END PROJECT]
Project 1 - Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning
Project 2 - Market Basket Analysis on SuperMarket Data

In the project 1, I have used Deep learning model and techniques on predicting customer churn.
As an alternative to traditional approach that many has built a model using different Machine Learning algorithmns and proposed their solutions, I had developed the model using Deep Leaning and deployed it to predict the member of individual churn and gained an accuracy of 80%.

In the Project 2, I have used Data mining techniques to develop the model.
Algorithm used - Apriori Algorithm with association rules.
Also built recommendation engine to suggest a product to the customer based on their past historical data
Segmented the customer into the respective regions based on the sales.
